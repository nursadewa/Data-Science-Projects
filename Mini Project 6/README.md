Mini Project 6: Diabetes Prediction Using Classification

For this project, I developed a classification model to predict the likelihood of a patient having diabetes based on various health metrics. The project used the diabetes dataset, which contains relevant medical data.

1. Objective:
The primary goal was to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether a patient has diabetes. This task was framed as a binary classification problem, where the target variable indicated the presence (or absence) of diabetes.

2. Dataset:
The dataset consisted of multiple features related to health and lifestyle, such as glucose levels, blood pressure, insulin levels, body mass index (BMI), and age. The target variable indicated whether the patient had diabetes.

3. Data Preprocessing:
Before building the model, I cleaned the dataset by handling missing values and outliers. I also performed feature scaling to ensure that the model could accurately interpret the health metrics, which varied widely in their ranges (e.g., glucose levels vs. BMI).

4. Model Selection:
I experimented with several classification algorithms, including:

◘ Logistic Regression
◘ Random Forest Classifier
◘ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
◘ Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Each model was trained and tested using a portion of the dataset.

5. Evaluation:
I evaluated the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure that the model was balanced and not biased towards false positives or false negatives. I also used confusion matrices and ROC-AUC curves to further assess performance.

6. Hyperparameter Tuning:
To optimize model performance, I used GridSearchCV to tune the hyperparameters of the best-performing models, such as the number of trees in the Random Forest or the regularization parameter in Logistic Regression.

7. Final Model:
After comparing the models, the Random Forest Classifier provided the best performance for this dataset. The model was able to accurately predict diabetes with high precision and recall, making it a reliable tool for medical professionals.

8. Conclusion:
This project demonstrated how machine learning can be applied to healthcare data to assist in early diagnosis. A well-performing classification model like this could be integrated into medical decision-making systems, potentially improving patient outcomes by identifying high-risk individuals.
