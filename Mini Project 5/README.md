Mini Project 5: Customer Segmentation Using RFM Analysis

In this project, I implemented Unsupervised Learning techniques to perform customer segmentation for an online retail dataset. The objective was to categorize customers into different segments based on their purchasing behaviors, using RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary).

1. RFM Model:
The RFM model was used to segment customers based on three key factors:

  ◘ Recency: How recently a customer made a purchase.
  ◘ Frequency: How often a customer makes purchases.
  ◘ Monetary: How much money a customer has spent.

2. Data Preparation:
I used the online retail dataset, which contained records of transactions, including customer IDs, purchase dates, and total purchase amounts. I cleaned and pre-processed the data to remove null entries and ensure accurate calculation of RFM values.

3. RFM Scoring:
I calculated the RFM values for each customer by assigning a score for each factor (Recency, Frequency, Monetary). These scores were then used to create a composite score that represents customer behavior. Higher scores indicated more valuable customers.

4. Customer Segmentation Using K-Means:
After calculating the RFM scores, I applied K-Means clustering to segment the customers into distinct groups. This unsupervised learning algorithm was chosen because it effectively groups customers with similar purchasing behaviors.

5. Result Interpretation:
The clustering results revealed several customer segments, such as:

◘ High-value customers: Customers who purchase frequently, spend a lot, and make recent purchases.
◘ At-risk customers: Customers who haven't made a recent purchase but have spent a significant amount in the past.
◘ Loyal customers: Customers who frequently purchase but may not have the highest spending.

6. Business Application:
These customer segments can be used by businesses to tailor marketing strategies for each group. For example, high-value customers can receive rewards or loyalty programs, while at-risk customers can be re-engaged through targeted promotions.

7. Conclusion:
This project demonstrated how unsupervised learning, combined with RFM analysis, can provide valuable insights for customer segmentation. By understanding customer behavior, businesses can create more personalized and effective marketing strategies.
